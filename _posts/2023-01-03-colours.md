title: "How Things Get Their Colour"
date: 2023-01-03
---

Inspired by a very interesting question from the Natural Sciences Trinity Interview Preparation Paper I came across during my mentoring, I thought I'd take the answer a bit further and try to explore the reason why some common things get the colours they do. 

I apologize in advance for the borked formatting and rough and perhaps not particularly clear explanations. This was just directly copied and pasted over from my personal notes to provide a placeholder resource until I get other things up here.

<h3> Why does a clear sky on Earth
appear blue and a cloudy sky white? Why is copper sulphate blue when hydrated
and white when anhydrous?</h3>

</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>A blue sky is a pure medium of air, and air
itself has a slight tint of blue to it.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>This is due to Rayleigh scattering</p>

</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>The light is interacting primarily here with
air molecules, which are SMALLER than the wavelength of light</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>If we treat the electrons in the air molecules
as simple harmonic oscillators (that oscillate about the nucleus at some innate
frequency equal to the frequency of light of an N2 or O2 atom for example). This
frequency tends to be in the UV, and thus much higher frequency than our light.
(So the electron will not absorb it, but it can still interact with it)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>In order for an electron to scatter light,
it needs to couple with the light and re-emit it. It is more easier for it to
couple to light of a more similar frequency than not. (The scattering is proportional
to approximately 1/lambda^4 if you do the very lengthy calculation that I
cannot expect them to reasonably ask someone to do on the spot)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>Since the “frequency” of the electron is
high compared to visible light, it can couple and therefore better scatter
higher frequencies of visible light than lower ones. Therefore shorter
wavelengths are scattered more than larger wavelengths</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>This means that if you have a beam of white
(broadband) light pointed at air, the blue light (lower wavelength, higher
frequency) will be scattered much more and the red light less. </p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>If the air is long enough, this means that
at short distances it will appear blue, and at far distances (i.e. a sunset
when the sun is at an angle), it will appear red. (Rayleigh scattering is also
angularly dependent, and tends to scatter light more to angles perpendicular to
the beam incidence).</p>

</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>Since these are small droplets and there are
many of them, even if a single reflection of a single droplet is specular, the
fact that there are so many of them and the mean free path of the light is
small, the light rays will get all mixed up and will lose spatial correlation
with the input. Therefore, this matte scattering is going to just mix around
all the incoming light and appear a somewhat uniform mix of those wavelengths.</p>

two identical individual atomic states creates two molecular orbital states one
slightly above and one slightly below in energy. </p>

</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>Having a double bond (i.e. a pi p-p bond)
which starts out at a slightly higher energy means that the way the molecular
orbitals end up, the next available state (the anti-bonding orbital from the
2sp2’s) is actually quite close! </p>

</span></span><span dir=LTR></span>Keep in mind that you have a structure of
infinite carbon atoms, and each of these extra atoms adds another offset state
to this continuum. The result of this is that you get a “band” of states in
graphene that is quite close and with a jumpable gap, whereas the “band” of
states in diamond is far away</p>

this gap in graphene, and since there are infinite states it can absorb any
colour above that energy threshold, meaning it appears black</p>

may notice in graphene the bands actually touch! However this “meeting point”
in the graphene bandgap is not at 0 wavevector (not Gamma but K rather). This
means that once light is absorbed it cannot come back down easily and the
energy needs to be taken by phonons before it can get back down.)</p>
