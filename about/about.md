# About Me:

## Who am I, the short version:
Hello! I am a fourth-year experimental particle physics PhD student in the [High Energy Physics Group](https://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk) in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge as a member of the ATLAS Collaboration on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, funded by the Gates Cambridge Scholarship.

My research is on searches for new particles beyond the standard model in ATLAS, focusing on the possibility that these new particles could be living long enough to travel some distance through the detector before decaying. I also have done hardware work, designing and developing the automatic strips sensors quality control automated decision and reporting framework for the ATLAS inner tracker upgrade (ITk). I also do teaching (supervisions/TAing) at Cambridge and outreach at CERN.

## What I do now:
### Analysis Research:
Our understanding of what parts the universe is made of and how they all interact with each other is detailed in a theory called the Standard Model (SM). This is one of the most precisely tested theories in science and (despite our hopes of finding new physics) has been confirmed to a stunning precision by nearly all laboratory experiments to date. However, the theory is still incomplete, unable to describe dark matter or even gravity. All this strongly hints at the existence of new as of yet undiscovered particles beyond the Standard Model (BSM).

We have tried searching for these particles for a long time, however since the Higgs discovery in 2012 we have not yet conclusively discovered any new particle. However, one key assumption that has been built into our searches at the LHC until somewhat recently is that whatever new particles we are searching for decaying instantly after they are made, and that the only things that make it through the detector are the decay products which should point back to the location of the proton-proton interaction in the centre of the detector.

However, why should the new particles we search for have such short lifetimes? Many regular standard model particles don't have such short lifetimes. In fact many mechanisms, such as weak couplings or small mass differences between the particle and its decay products, or a decay via an off-shell mediator (i.e. some particle in the decay process is forced to have a virtual mass very far from its normal mass) can cause particles to have long lifetimes. Depending on the type of particle and decay, different long-lived particles (LLPs) will have different signatures in the detector.

I specifically focus on displaced vertex (DV) signatures, which are the case where the "new" particle lives long enough to travel somewhat through the pixel inner detector in ATLAS before decaying into many tracks, where some number of them are charged. This looks like a vertex of tracks in the detector that is displaced from the proton-proton collision point, hence the name. There are countless BSM models that have been developed by theorists trying to propose what could be the missing piece to the standard model, and quite a few do predict new long-lived particles that create displaced vertex signatures. In particular, supersymmetry (SUSY) with certain parameters, and the Higgs-portal model.

It is unfortunately physically impossible to record every proton-proton collision, as they happen every 25 ns, and most collisions are "boring" anyways. Therefore, there is a triggering system that looks for basic "interesting" things that happen. "Interesting" things that can be triggered on were quite limited in Run 2, so we rely on quite general things that occured during the collision, like a lot of jets (basically jets of quarky stuff) or missing energy in a part of the detector.

My first analysis was DV+Jets, where we searched for displaced vertices in collision events that were triggered on because they had a lot of jets. One of my primary contributions was in studying the simulations to deeply understand our backgrounds (in other words, what else could create displaced vertices in the detector that are not new long-lived particles) and how our estimation methods were dealing with it. Another of my primary contributions was in developing a new method to estimate the hadronic interactions background (in other words figure out how many displaced vertices we expect to see from just random stable or SM long-lived particles smashing into detector material). 

I also did some minor studies looking into improving the estimate 

The paper is currently undergoing the internal ATLAS review process, however public results are available [here](). (Spoiler alert, unfortunately it does not seem we discovered new physics).

With that analysis over, I am now analysis contact (leader) of a new analysis, the DV+MET full Run 2 analysis, where our very international team attempts to overcome the scheduling issues that come with having people in full gamut of timezones and search for new physics

The inner tracker of ATLAS is getting an upgrade (ITk) for the high-lumi LHC (Run 4)! There will be 

### Teaching:

I supervised (the Cambridge version of TAing but with much fewer students) the Part IB (2nd year) Mathematical Methods, Part II (3rd year) Particle and Nuclear Physics, and Part III (Masters) Particle Physics modules. 

As I started my PhD with no particle physics background, and found many resources confusing and inaccessible, I have along my learning and teaching journey been writing a textbook aimed at trying to get other students that are in my position with basic calculus knowledge to working particle physics knowledge in a 

### Outreach:

Outreach

I am a mentor at the Hong Kong Academy for Gifted Education, 

At CERN I am also a tour guide for the visits service and the ATLAS secretariat for various visit points including the ATLAS cavern for both general public and internal tours.

Lenses work by having a different thickness of glass at different parts of the lens. Since light slows down in glass, and since light is a wave, this means that the waves of incoming light at different points of the lens will be at different phases when they leave the lens. One can think of this phase difference across the lens as what is causing the light to bend and focus. However, if you have nanostructures around the wavelength of light

Due to the complete mess that is the above, I have resided in 6 different countries and visited 51 UN member states (plus approximately 10 other territories that people would normally consider countries).

My mother tongue is English, however I also speak French as I had done most of my schooling prior to undergrad in French. I am learning German, and have previously learned to a very elementary level the languages from the countries I have resided in. Linguistics 

Prior to my undergrad I was also trained as a classical pianist, and obtained an 

I enjoy hiking, skiing, and coxing (the person in a rowing boat team that doesn't do any exercise but steers and yells at the people doing the actual exercise), and have written two full-length fiction novels which are terrible and will never see the light of day. However my favourite hobby is **obscure festivals*
