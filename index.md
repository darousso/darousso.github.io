# David Rousso

Hello! I am a fourth-year experimental particle physics PhD student in the [High Energy Physics Group](https://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk) in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge as a member of the ATLAS Collaboration on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, funded by the Gates Cambridge Scholarship.

My research is on searches for new particles beyond the standard model in ATLAS, focusing on the possibility that these new particles could be living long enough to travel some distance through the detector before decaying. I also have done hardware work, designing and developing the automatic strips sensors quality control automated decision and reporting framework for the ATLAS inner tracker upgrade (ITk). I also do teaching (supervisions/TAing) at Cambridge and outreach at CERN.

Much like my thesis, this website is currently just an empty shell under construction, but will eventually be filled with my research interests and history, CV, and resources I have created for my teaching.
